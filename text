`Holland and Barret are a company focused on the health and happiness of their consumers, I consider the opportunity to add to the customer experience through optimising the delivery of products would be a highly valuable opportunity.`

`I have always had a keen interest in problem solving, this can be seen through my research project where I used Python skills which I have developed independently over the past 11 months. Having had no experience manually analysing image data, I managed to make confirmed detections of lemurs in low resolution thermal images taken in drone flight. This achievement further confirms my belief that new challenges are not something to be intimidated by but opportunities to learn. This cross-disciplinary project involved a large amount of collaboration with a Software Engineer, a Meteorologist, and Astrophysicists.`

`This project and a variety of other projects throughout my course have further confirmed my belief that new challenges are not something to be intimidated by, put opportunities for growth if you are willing to maintain a positive attitude.`
