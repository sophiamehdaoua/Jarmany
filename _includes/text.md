`I have always had a keen interest in problem solving, this can be seen through my research project where I used Python skills which I have developed independently over the past year. Having had no experience manually analysing image data, I managed to make confirmed detections of lemurs in low resolution thermal images taken in drone flight. This achievement further confirms my belief that new challenges are not something to be intimidated by but opportunities to learn. This cross-disciplinary project involved a large amount of collaboration with a Software Engineer, a Meteorologist, and Astrophysicists.`

`I’m a highly self motivated person, since completing my masters I’ve strived to continuously expand my skills.  In my free time, I have been conducting analysis into a US Fatal Police Shootings dataset combined with census data in R, learning basic HTML/CSS as well as ArcGIS, and gaining experience as a Code Volunteer (mainly Python) with Ignite Hubs. Lastly I’ve been training as an Impact Analyst with the organisation Impaakt which involves writing articles using a high level of quantitative information on how companies fall in line with the UN SDGs. This has encouraged me to conduct thorough research into a variety of businesses globally, which has improved my commercial awareness.` 

 *Thank you for considering me for this role, I'm available immediately and look forward to hearing from you soon!*
