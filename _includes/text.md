`Currently we are in a period of increasing uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning providing insight for businesses has never been more crucial. To be able to provide this as a Data Scientist with Kantar is an opportunity I’m highly interested in.` 

`I have always had a keen interest in problem solving, this can be seen through my research project where I used Python skills which I have developed independently over the past 11 months. Having had no experience manually analysing image data, I managed to make confirmed detections of lemurs in low resolution thermal images taken in drone flight. This achievement further confirms my belief that new challenges are not something to be intimidated by but opportunities to learn. This cross-disciplinary project involved a large amount of collaboration with a Software Engineer, a Meteorologist, and Astrophysicists.`  

`Furthermore, I’m an experienced R user and have intermediate experience using SQL through my Introduction to Data Analysis module, and some experience using SQL and JavaScript for querying big data frameworks.`  

`Lastly, I would love to relocate to Portugal, it is a beautiful country, I have friends in Lisbon, and I’m eager to spend my free time learning Portugese.` 

 `Thank you for considering me for this role,`

*I look forward to hearing from you!*
