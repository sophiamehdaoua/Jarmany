`Sustainable development is an area that I have always had a passion for, having graduated from my masters in Data Science, I would like to be able to use these skills to contribute to innovative solutions to a variety of environmental issues as I believe technology is beginning to play an increasingly crucial role in solving them.`

`I have always had a keen interest in problem solving, this can be seen through my research project where I used Python skills which I have developed independently over the past 11 months. Having had no experience manually analysing image data, I managed to make confirmed detections of lemurs in low resolution thermal images taken in drone flight. This achievement further confirms my belief that new challenges are not something to be intimidated by but opportunities to learn.`

`This is the attitude I would like to bring to Stantec, between now and the beginning of the Graduate Data Analyst role I plan to dedicate a lot of practice to object-oriented languages such as JavaScript and Ruby, as well as continuously develop my analytical skills through R and Python.`

 `Thank you for considering me for this role,`

*I look forward to hearing from you!*
